Background & Introduction: The Blocky Game

Blocky is a game with simple moves on a simple structure, but like a Rubik’s Cube, it is quite challenging to play. The game is played on a randomly-generated game board made of squares of different colors.

The goal of the game is to put the most possible units of a given color c on the outer perimeter of the board. The player’s score is the total number of unit cells of color c that are on the perimeter. There is a premium on corner cells: they count twice towards the score. After each move, the player sees their score, determined by how well they have achieved their goal. The game continues for a certain number of turns or until the user runs out of moves
